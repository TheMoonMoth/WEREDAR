## App Description
Here at WEREdar we are committed to protecting your community from the curse of the lycan.

For thousands of years werewolves have feasted on unsuspecting humans every full moon, but no longer. With the help of WEREDAR you can now stay safe by tracking werewolf sightings in your neighborhood. This easy to use app includes a map with werewolf location pins, a lunar cycle tracker, and a report-a-werewolf-sighting form. These are the essential tools you need to stay alert and stay alive.

## User Experience
User opens the web app and is presented with a home screen depicting a map with the last known location of all known werewolves as well as a moon phase tracker. The map allows the user to see if a wolf has been spotted near them and the moon phase tracker helps them prepare for dangerous full moons.
